Measurements were conducted in accordance with standardized test methods (ISO 8302 or ASTM C177) over a temperature range from 20 °C to 160 °C (293 K to 433 K).  Following a blind round-robin format, specimens of non-woven fibrous glass mat, approximately 22 mm thick and having a nominal bulk density of 200 kg/m3, were prepared and studied.  Results of the study show that the thermal conductivity measurements agree over the temperature range of interest to within ±1.0 %, or less.
